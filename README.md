# CalendarExercise

1. Allows the user to specify three inputs: A Start Date, the Number of days to display and a Country Code literal (the country code literal value is defined by the user with the keyboard). 
Example: 
  Start Date: 8/15/2008 
  Number of days: 17 
  Country Code: US 

2. Renders a calendar that spans as many weeks as necessary in order to cover the defined number of days. If the date range spans months, a new header is created for that month. The Calendar displays its days starting on Sunday and ending on Saturday. This works with any number of days regardless of the years, meaning that, if the user specifies more than 365 days, calendars are generated accordingly for the next year and so on.

  A. Weekends are yellow. 
  B. Weekdays are green. 
  C. Invalid days are hidden and the background should be gray. 
  D. Holidays are in orange
